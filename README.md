# The PacMen Exercise

## Description

A self-study-exercise I solved during the [MITx Fullstack Programming Course](https://xpro.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:xPRO+PCCx/)

Multiple PacMen in the form of simply being an image - can be generated and automatically move around the screen. When they hit a wall they bounce off it sort of "realistically". They stay at the same velocity though, hence there is no gravity simulation implemented! The initial velocity is randomized.

Some things I learned from the exercise:

- JavaScript can be used for simple "graphical" programming.
- A factory is simply put: Generating a whole lot of things! In this case: Making countless PacMen.
- Rudimentary ideas to "physics programming" to make the PacMen bounce off walls.
- How to programatically add HTML elements to a webpage.
- How to programatically _style_ HTML elements.
- A "shadow DOM" is a common pattern in JavaScript programming.

## Roadmap

Well, I guess there is no actual roadmap for this project but here a collection of ideas that might be fun to implement:

- [ ] Use alternating pictures as the image for a PacMan to simulate its mouth movement.
- [x] Add random things, instead of PacMen.
